See the [Getting Started](https://thermion.dev/getting_started) and [Quickstart](https://thermion.dev/quickstart) sections of the documentation for step-by-step instructions in creating a Flutter app.
 
You can also jump straight to the [Quickstart example in the repository](https://github.com/nmfisher/thermion/tree/develop/examples/flutter/quickstart/lib/main.dart) for an example of a Flutter app that uses a simple 3D viewer widget.

For a more advanced example, see the [Viewer example in the repository](https://github.com/nmfisher/thermion/tree/develop/examples/flutter/viewer/lib/main.dart).
