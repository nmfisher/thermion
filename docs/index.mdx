Thermion is a framework for creating cross-platform 3D applications with Dart and/or Flutter.

## Overview

### Package structure 

Thermion is divided into two packages:
- `thermion_flutter`, a Flutter package for creating/embedding a rendering surface inside a Flutter app. 
- `thermion_dart`, which contains all the code needed to create a viewer.

With this structure, the Flutter-specific components are not coupled to the Dart components, meaning Thermion can be used for rendering in both Flutter and non-Flutter applications.

For example, Thermion ships with examples for rendering with Dart only (no Flutter) with a CLI/headless application on MacOS, and with a Javascript/WASM/HTML applicaiton in browsers.

`thermion_flutter` exports `thermion_dart`, so if you are working with a Flutter application, you will only need to import `thermion_fluttter`.
