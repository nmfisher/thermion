# Debugging

If something is crashing or not working as expected, you can enable verbose logging and/or debug builds (particularly useful for debugging with lldb or getting legible stack traces):

Add a `hooks` section to your app's `pubspec.yaml`, e.g.
```
name: example_cli
description: A sample command-line application.
version: 1.0.0

environment:
  sdk: ^3.3.0

# Add the below
hooks:
  user_defines:
    thermion_dart: 
      mode: debug
      tracing: enabled
```

After changing the `hooks` section, make sure you run `flutter clean` to propagate the changes correctly.

> [!CAUTION]
> Debug builds won't work for Android. This is a known upstream issue with Filament.

Unless `mode: debug` is specified in your `pubspec.yaml`, Thermion will use release builds under the hood, even if your app is compiled/runing in debug mode.
