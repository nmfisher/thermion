## iOS

### Min iOS version

Thermion requires a minimum iOS version of 13.0. When building a Flutter application, ensure your application's `ios/Podfile` contains the following:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

and in ios/Info.plist:

```xml
<key>LSMinimumSystemVersion</key>
<string>13.0</string>
```

When submitting to the App Store, you may encounter an error saying `thermion_dart.framework does not supported the minimum deployment target in Info.plist`. 

This is because Flutter hardcodes a deployment target of iOS 12.0 when invoking the native assets build, which conflicts with actual requirement.

After running `flutter build ios` (but before archiving the build and submitting to the App Store), run the following script to replace the `MinimumOSVersion`:

```
#!/bin/zsh

# Array of directories containing Info.plist files
directories=(
    "./build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app/Frameworks/thermion_dart.framework"
    "./build/ios/Release-iphoneos/Runner.app/Frameworks/thermion_dart.framework"
    "./build/native_assets/ios/thermion_dart.framework"
)

# Loop through each directory
for dir in "${directories[@]}"; do
    plist_path="$dir/Info.plist"
    
    # Check if Info.plist exists in the directory
    if [[ -f "$plist_path" ]]; then
        echo "Processing: $plist_path"
        
        # Use PlistBuddy to change the MinimumOSVersion
        /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :MinimumOSVersion 13.0" "$plist_path" 2>/dev/null
        
        if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
            echo "✓ Successfully updated version to 13.0"
        else
            echo "✗ Failed to update version in $plist_path"
        fi
    else
        echo "✗ Info.plist not found in $dir"
    fi
done
```
