## Linux support

Currently, only the Dart package (`thermion_dart`) will work on Linux (primarily for the automated build/testing pipeline). 

Filament has been built for Ubuntu 22.04; other distributions may work, but YMMV.

The Flutter package (`thermion_flutter`) won't work; it's missing the platform glue code necessary to set up the render target.  Support will eventually be added, but there is currently no estimated timeline.

Contributions are welcome and it's actually not a lot of work. Join the Discord if you want to help out.
