## Getting Started

Thermion currently requires the Flutter `master` channel with the `native-assets` experiment enabled.

1. Switch to Flutter master channel, upgrade Flutter, create a new project, then add `thermion_flutter` as a dependency

```bash
$ flutter channel master
$ flutter upgrade
$ flutter config --enable-native-assets  
$ cd your_flutter_project
$ flutter pub add thermion_flutter
```

2. If running on iOS or MacOS, change the minimum deployment target to OSX 13

<Accordion title="Click to open iOS/MacOS instructions">

Make sure the `platform` entry refers to `13.0` in your Podfile.

In `macos/Podfile` (for macOS):
```
platform :osx, '13.0'
```

In `ios/Podfile`, (for iOS):
```
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

Then open XCode:
```
open macos/Runner.xcworkspace
```

and change the minimum deployment target to 13.0:
