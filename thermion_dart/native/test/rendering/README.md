# Scheduling regressions

Run from the repository root with CMake 3.22+ and a C++17 compiler. The suite
needs no Filament, Dart, or Flutter installation. It targets desktop Linux,
macOS, and Windows. Run it manually using the commands below.

```sh
cmake -S thermion_dart/native/test/rendering -B /tmp/thermion-scheduling
cmake --build /tmp/thermion-scheduling --config Release
ctest --test-dir /tmp/thermion-scheduling -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Coverage:

- Gate totals under regular 60, 90, 120, and 144 Hz source ticks; alternating
  1/2-vsync gaps for 60 fps on 90 Hz; the 1 ms early-admission boundary; zero
  timestamps, stalls, rate changes, unlimited mode, and reset.
- Clock mapping with distinct epochs, missing/future timestamps, underflow,
  recovery without backwards time, and a changed clock offset after sleep.
- On macOS, preceding-vsync estimates with missing or invalid CVDisplayLink
  metadata, measured rate adjustment, and overflow-safe Mach tick conversion.
- Generic timer rate increases/decreases and prompt stop while waiting. On
  Windows, the same checks force a failed VBlank wait through DXGI's fallback,
  assert that it stops retrying VBlank, and exercise the shared timer loop.

The clock mapper estimates frame age from nearby source-clock and steady-clock
samples. Sampling delay introduces error. Missing or implausible Apple timing
data falls back to delivery time, as the timer source does; recovery is clamped
to nondecreasing time. The fallback is not a measured hardware vsync.

These tests do not measure physical presentation intervals, animation
smoothness, Android looper behavior, live Apple display-link callbacks, or
successful DXGI hardware waits. Stopping DXGI's timer wait is interruptible;
an in-progress hardware `WaitForVBlank` must still return before stop completes.

Native Android callbacks remain registered at display frequency even when the
gate rejects rendering work. Device validation should check the cadence and
wakeup cost at low target rates and during display refresh changes.

The gate extraction is reused by the web worker in #301. Forwarding scheduler
timestamps through Flutter into rendering is in #319. Normalizing native scheduler output alone does not replace the existing
Dart wall-clock render timestamp. Browser dispatch/lifetime fixtures land in #301.

## KTX upload lifetime tests

The caller owns the KTX bundle. `destroy()` immediately deletes it and its data;
calling it while queued creation or an upload still uses the data is invalid.
Texture creation returns before buffer release is guaranteed. Keep the bundle
alive until the upload-release callback arrives, then destroy it explicitly.
Created textures have their own lifetime and must be destroyed separately.

Skybox and IBL loaders keep setup and buffer-release Futures separate. Setup
errors reach the public Future; bundle cleanup waits for buffer release even
when setup fails. Successful loads do not add a GPU-completion wait. Removal
and disposal flush pending work and wait for bundle cleanup, as before.

Native partial-submission failure handling is a separate change. This PR does
not guarantee release notification if Filament fails during submission.
Run the Dart integration tests from `thermion_dart/`:

```sh
THERMION_UPLOAD_LIFETIME_FIXTURE=/tmp/thermion-scheduling/libupload_lifetime_fixture.dylib \
  dart test --concurrency=1 test/ktx_upload_lifetime_test.dart test/skybox_tests.dart
```

The fixture is built by the CMake commands above. On Linux use
`libupload_lifetime_fixture.so`; on Windows use `Release/upload_lifetime_fixture.dll`
and set the variable using your shell's syntax. The tests require a working GPU
backend (Metal on macOS). They gate the worker to verify release is still pending,
exercise cubemap/mipmapped/2D uploads followed by explicit bundle destruction,
and check public skybox/IBL failure delivery. Dart's native build hook builds
Thermion and obtains Filament.
